    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "You are an urban data scientist analyzing neighborhood characteristics and quality of life metrics across different areas. Your task is to build a comprehensive geospatial analysis using OpenStreetMap data and Census information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements:\n",
    "1. Geospatial Data Collection\n",
    "- Use OpenStreetMap API to collect Points of Interest (POIs) data\n",
    "- Calculate walkability scores based on POI density and diversity \n",
    "- Get neighborhood boundaries and geographic features\n",
    "- Collect Census demographic and socioeconomic indicators get free key from https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Data Processing & Integration \n",
    "- Clean and standardize location data\n",
    "- Calculate spatial metrics (e.g., POI density, distances)\n",
    "- Join Census data with geographic boundaries\n",
    "- Handle missing values and outliers\n",
    "- Store all collected data in SQLite database tables with appropriate schemas\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Analysis & Modeling\n",
    "- Develop walkability and livability scores\n",
    "- Cluster neighborhoods based on characteristics \n",
    "- Build ML models to predict quality of life metrics\n",
    "- Analyze spatial patterns and relationships\n",
    "- Query and analyze data from SQLite database\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Insights & Visualization\n",
    "- Create maps showing spatial distributions\n",
    "- Visualize relationships between variables\n",
    "- Generate neighborhood profiles and rankings\n",
    "- Document key findings and recommendations\n",
    "- Export analysis results to SQLite for persistence\n"
